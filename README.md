Simply(no tracking/ads) a Open Source Swift-powered QR Code reader with the option to scan existing photos for iOS, I do
hope to eventually include other barcode standards that might be useful in a offline context.

Will only implement Crashlytics for crash reporting so I can hopefully identify bugs etc.

My first attempt at a public project I hope to learn alot while publishing my code such as workflows and automated testing.

Hopefully I don't dump my own creds/keys by accident.

Thanks for checking out my project!
