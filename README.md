# SimplyQR
Simply(no tracking/ads) a Open Source Swift-powered QR Code reader with the option to scan existing photos for iOS 
hope to include other barcode standards that might be useful in a offline context.
Will only implement Crashlytics for crash reporting so I can hopefully identify bugs etc.

My first attempt at a public project I hope to learn alot while publishing my code!

Hopefully I don't dump my own creds/keys by accident.

Thanks for checking out this repo!
