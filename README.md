Simply(no tracking/ads) a Open Source Swift-powered QR Code reader with the future option to also scan existing photos from your phone, I do
hope to eventually include other barcode standards that might be useful in a offline context.

After some thinking I'm leaning towards using functions provided by apple to store scan history and handle crash analytics iirc I think they do provide that service, Instead of using firebase.

My first attempt at a public project I hope to learn alot while publishing my code such as workflows and automated testing.
Hopefully I don't dump my own creds/keys by accident.

Once sort of complete will publish to the app store - way too many ad infested qr code scanners other then I guess the main apple ios camera app for scanning :p but hey it's just a practice project I made to boost my poor morale lol

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my project!


# Timeline

10/30 
- Starting history view deciding if we should store history as a user object in firebase or just locally like in a db leaning towards the latter.
- Basic Scanner works with thanks to the folks at hacking swift via there CodeScanner Lib, 
Will have to learn more to eventually implement my own scanning functionality.


# TODO
Sorted by Priority (High to Low)

- Create a History View - work in progress
- Create a Settings View
- Create a existing photo scan flow - work in progress
- Implement a error handling/crashlytics
- Maybe a update check


# Credits

Currently I'm utilizing [CodeScanner](https://github.com/twostraws/CodeScanner) lib which was made by Paul Hudson, who writes free Swift tutorials over at Hacking with Swift but I do plan on creating my own as I get more comfortable with Swift. 
Itâ€™s available under the MIT license, which permits commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use.
